#Steve and Josh are bored and want to play something. They don't want to think too much, so they come up with a really simple game. Write a function called winner and figure out who is going to win.
#They are dealt the same number of cards. They both flip the card on the top of their deck. Whoever has a card with higher value wins the round and gets one point (if the cards are of the same value, neither of them gets a point). After this, the two cards are discarded and they flip another card from the top of their deck. They do this until they have no cards left.
#deckSteve and deckJosh are arrays representing their decks. They are filled with cards, represented by a single character. The card rank is as follows (from lowest to highest): 
#(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A)

#the code in here acts as a function that takes two arrays (deck_steve and deck_josh) as arguments, and returns the overall winner and number of wins between the two players, steve and josh.
